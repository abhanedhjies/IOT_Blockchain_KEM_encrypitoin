## 🔐 Encryption Details You'll See

When you register a device, you'll see:

```
Device ID: BP_MON_001
Status: ✓ ACTIVE

Encryption Protocol: Kyber-inspired Post-Quantum KEM

🔑 Public Key:
0x7f4a8b9c2e1d5f3a6b8c4e9d2f1a7c5b8e3d6f9a2c5e8b1d4f7a0c3e6b9...
(Full 256-bit key visible)

🔒 Shared Secret:
0x9d3f5c7a2e6b1f8d4c9a5e2b7f3d6a9c1e8f5b2d7a4c9e6f1b8d5a2e9c...
(Derived from KEM encapsulation)

Encryption Algorithm: HMAC-SHA256
Gateway ID: GATEWAY_HUB_001
Authenticated: 1/28/2026, 10:55:37 AM

## 🖥️ Dashboard Panels Explained

### Left Column: Control Panel
- **Device Simulator**: Where you create devices
- **Blockchain Registration**: Where you register to blockchain

### Right Column: Crypto Display
- **Encryption Details**: Full cryptography information
- Dynamic - updates as you view different devices

### Bottom Row: Information
- **Stored Devices**: MongoDB persistence view
  - Shows all registered devices
  - Displays public key preview
  - Shows event counts
  
- **Blockchain Events**: Audit trail
